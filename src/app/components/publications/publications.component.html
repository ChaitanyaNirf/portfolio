    <p><strong>Published in:</strong> Springer</p>
    <p class="publication-abstract">
      This paper presents "NLSQL," a system for converting natural language queries into SQL queries, 
      improving existing approaches by enhancing parsing and JOIN query handling. Our approach supports 
      multiple tables and complex SQL commands, yielding strong results in real-world testing.
